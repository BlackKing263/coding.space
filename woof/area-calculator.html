<div class="container">

		<p>In this project, we're going to make an application with which the user can quickly calculate the area of the shapes we program. If you do every step, you will know how to use functions! Functions are extremely important in all programming languages!</p>
		<br><a target="_blank" href="./code/area-calculator-code.html">Play this demo in full screen.</a>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>1) Create shapes that will represent shapes your program will calculate the area of. The example shows a square, a rectangle, a triangle, a circle, and an ellipse. Use any shapes you like! </p>

	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>2) Create text sprites at or near your shapes with text signaling to the user that they should click it to calculate the area. </p>

	</div>

	<div class="block">
		<p>3) Create a text sprite to act as the calculator window. Place some default text there.</p>

	</div>

	<div class="block">
		<p>4) When you click on a shape, change the text in the window to the name of that shape (hint: object.text = 'your text' would change the text of an object to 'your text'.)</p>

	<div class="block">
		<p>5) When a user clicks on the area text (not the shape) for the square, prompt the user to input a side length and place the number that they input into the window.</p>

	<div class="block">
		<p>6) Create a function <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp' target="_blank">(check out functions at W3schools for help)</a> that returns the area of a square given a side length parameter. Use that function and the user input to calculate the area of the shape square and put the result in the display window. Be sure that the math of your program returns the correct result. </p>

	<div class="block">
		<p>7) Create functions that return the area for each shape (research the internet to find shape areas if you don't know them). Make every shape's area text trigger a user prompt and return the area into the display window. </p>

		<p>8) For each area calculation, replace the single number result in the window with more descriptive text. </p>

	<div class="block">
		<p>9) Use a javascript function to limit the results that you get to 2 decimal points (use search engine to find it). </p>

		<p>10) Challenge: Animate your application or add perimeter calculations or other math functions. </p>
