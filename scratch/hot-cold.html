  <h1>Hot or Cold: Mystery Number</h1>
  <div class="container">
    
    <div class="block">
      <p>Can you guess the mystery number?!? It's between 0 and 100.</p>

      <p>1) Choose a backdrop and a character to host the game.</p>

    <div class="block">
      <p>2) Have your host intoduce the game and explain what this game is about. 
        "I have a mystery number between 0 and 100. Can you guess what it is?"
        Remember to make sure the player has a space to enter their guess
        and start the playing. 
      </p>

        3) It's time to make the mystery number!
      </p> 
      <p>        
        When the player enters a guess, have your host check if the answer is a number between 0 and 100.
        If it isn't remind the player of the rules.  
      </p> 
        <p> Then check if the answer is the same as
        as the mystery number. If the guess is equal to the mystery 
        number, celebrate! Else, the host should ask the player to try again. 
      </p>

    <div class="block">

        4) Let's keep track of the player's guesses by creating a list of guesses. 
        Add each new answer to the list.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the player repeats a guess, let them know they've guessed it already.  
        Else add the answer to list and tell them they didn't get it right. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Make it so that the list is visible only after the player guesses.
      </p>

    <div class="block">
      <p>
        5) Can we make the host tell the player how many tries it took for them to guess the mystery number?
        We can use the length of the list to construct the response. ;-)
      </p>

    <div class="block">
      <p>
        6) It's time to give our player hints of how far their guess is from the mystery number. 
        Let's start by calcualting the difference between the guess and the mystery number. 
        
      </p>
      <iframe width="485" height="402" src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/embed/294383303/?autostart=false" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
    </div>  
    
    <div class="block">
      <p>
        7) Let's start giving the player feedback about their guesses. 
      </p>
      
        <p>
          If the difference between
        the guess and the mystery number is less than 5, then the guess is  "HOT!"; else "Cold"  
        </p>
        <p>
          If the difference is between 5 and 10, they're guess is "WARM!"; else "COLD!", etc..
        </p>
      
      <p>You can add as many layers as you'd like.
          We added Hot, Warm, Luke Warm, Tepid, Cold, ICE-Cold. 
      </p>
      <p>

          Hint: use the absolute value of the difference to measure how far the guess is. 
          The block you're looking for is in operators. 
      </p>
      <iframe width="485" height="402" src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/embed/294388178/?autostart=false" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
    </div>  
    
    <div class="block">
      <p>
        8) Let's clean up our code. 
        The player should never see the mystery number and the difference. 
        The list should be hidden until someone makes a guess.
      </p>
      <p>
          Are you satisfied? 
          Let's tell our player to click the green flag to play again.
