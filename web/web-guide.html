<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">​Luckily, just like you can use Google Translate to input a foreign language and get english in return, a&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:700">browser</span>&nbsp;takes the document full of code and turns it into the kind of webpage you’re used to seeing. &nbsp;<br><br>The code above is actually the code for the&nbsp;<a href="http://nytimes.com">New York Times website</a>. &nbsp;Not even a professional programmer could have figured that out just by looking that that snippet of code -- that’s what we have<span style="font-weight:700">&nbsp;</span>browsers for.<br><br><u><font size="5">So what are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?</font></u><br><br>HTML, CSS, and JS are three different coding languages that do different things. &nbsp;They are the three, and only three, different programming languages that our browser knows how to turn into a web page. &nbsp;Most web pages that you see online use all three of them. &nbsp;Let’s break it down:<br><br><span style="font-weight:700">HTML</span>&nbsp;is everything on the page that you see, including words, images, links, and embedded content. &nbsp;The following page uses only HTML:&nbsp;<a href="http://output.jsbin.com/zovayu">http://output.jsbin.com/zovayu</a><br><br><span style="font-weight:700">CSS</span>&nbsp;controls how the HTML looks by changing the fonts, the text or background color, the alignment, etc. &nbsp;Here is the same webpage as before with CSS to make it prettier:&nbsp;<a href="http://output.jsbin.com/jekedu/2">http://output.jsbin.com/jekedu/</a><br><br>Did you notice anything different? &nbsp;(Hint: background color, content was centered, text color, font.) &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:700">All of these changes were done using CSS</span>.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="font-weight:700">JavaScript</span>&nbsp;makes things happen. &nbsp;A webpage will remain exactly the same unless you use JavaScript. &nbsp;JavaScript also allows the user to interact with the webpage, by allowing you to trigger events. &nbsp;Here is the same page that has JS added:&nbsp;<a href="http://output.jsbin.com/mujuza">http://output.jsbin.com/mujuza</a><br><br>Do you see how the background of the page is changing colors? &nbsp;That wouldn’t be possible without JavaScript, because HTML/CSS can’t change on their own. &nbsp;Also, did you try clicking on the icon? &nbsp;The title changes size because we told it in JavaScript that if the picture was clicked the title should grow.<br>How do you start coding?At this point you have a pretty good idea of how the web works and the differences between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. &nbsp;Now,&nbsp;<a href="/html-guide.html">let’s start coding in HTML</a>.</div>
